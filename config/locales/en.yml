# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      description: |
        To create a new iCal Feed, add a CONSTRUCT SPARQL to the artsdata-stewards <a href='https://github.com/artsdata-stewards/artsdata-actions/tree/main/ical'>iCal Github repository</a>.
        It will appear in the list of iCal Feeds at the top of this page.
        Then copy the iCal Feed URL and use it with the Calendar iCal/ICS plugin of your choice.
        To test an iCal Feed, copy the iCal Feed URL and paste it into this free Wordpress calendar plugin: <a href='https://icscalendar.com/preview/'>ICS Calendar</a>.</p>

    title: "Databus Artifact"
    description: |
      <p>The Artsdata Databus stores metadata about your datasets. It does not store the data itself. Before using the databus you must first publish your data somewhere on the Web. Databus organizes datasets by <code><< group >> << artifact >> << version >></code>. 
      Each versioned artifact has a download URL that must not change. The Artsdata knowledge graph may subscribe to your dataset and load artifacts in the background as new versions become available.</p> 
      <p>Please manage Artifacts with the <a href='https://culturecreates.github.io/artsdata-data-model/architecture/graph-store-api.html'>Artsdata Databus API</a>. 
      To create a new version use the <a href='https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3157443/TVep7mv3#f12d3dc0-5c37-496b-985f-95388660b984'>POST /databus</a> endpoint with <code>publisher=</code> set to your Databus Account URI. 
      To manage accounts please visit artsdata-stewards <a href="https://github.com/orgs/artsdata-stewards/teams/databus/teams">databus teams</a>.</p>  
      <p>An artifact may also be created directly using the "create artifact" button if the source is a website with structured data or Google speadsheet. 
      Once an artifact is create you may manually create an artifact version within the Artsdata interface: 
      click on the URL of the databus artifact you just created, then, under <code>Potential actions</code>, select <code>Create an artifact version of [artifactname]</code>. 
      This will create an artifact version, upload the data to the knowledge graph and add the dataset to the list of data sources.</p>
