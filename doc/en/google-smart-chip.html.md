Artsdata Google Smart Chips
===================
A Google Workspace™ add-on that detects [Artsdata URIs](https://culturecreates.github.io/artsdata-data-model/identifier-recommendations.html#about-the-artsdata-identifier) in Google Sheets™ documents and displays previews about linked event, people, place or organization entities. 

The add-on reads URLs in Google Sheets™ documents and detects those that match the Artsdata URI format. When the user hovers over the link, a preview card is displayed with additional information about the entity.

**Note :** The _"Replace URL with its title?"_ feature is not recommended with Google Sheets™ documents that are intended for upload to Artsdata. Artsdata's Google Sheets™ Extract-Transform-Load workflow only reads the actual cell values; not hyperlinks. Replacing your Artsdata URIs by their title will override your URIs and make them no longer importable by Artsdata.
