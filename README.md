# README

Artsdata Nebula is a website for technical users to view and manage Artsdata datafeeds and Artsdata minted entities.  

Nebula is built ontop of the Artsdata API Plaform. It includes a generic RDF viewer that can render any linked data, not only data from Artsdata. For example, external webpages with structured data can be viewed in Nebula.

This is a 'low code' website with all business logic and data validation rules managed in external data files using [SPARQL](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-sparql/) and [SHACL](<https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-shacl/#:~:text=The%20Shapes%20Constraint%20Language%20(SHACL,data%20instead%20of%20enabling%20inferencing.>).  All tablular views and graph views are generated using SPARQL. All data validation reports and conditions required for minting are generated using SHACL. User athentication is managed with Github.

This website does [content negoitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation) and will dereference Artsdata URIs following [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) principles.

This is a work in progress...
